# Movie_Application

For my passion project, my goal was to create a movie list website to store and keep track of the movie that users watched recently, which would allow users to add, edit, and leave a review for each movie. 

The project has three tables: movies, reviews and reviewers (bridging table). The movies and reviews tables have a many-to-many relationship. That means a movie can have many reviews. A review can be in many movies. 

CRUD for movie, review and reviewer.
Added an API call for listing all reviews for a particular movie.
Added an API call for listing all reviewers under a particular review.

Features Included:
